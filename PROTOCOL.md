# Hughes Power Watchdog BLE Protocol

This document describes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication
protocol used by Hughes Power Watchdog surge protectors, covering both
Gen1 (BT-only) and Gen2 (WiFi+BT) hardware.

## Gen1 vs Gen2: Protocol Compatibility

The BLE data protocol is **identical** between Gen1 and Gen2 hardware.
Both generations use the same GATT characteristic, handshake sequence,
packet framing, and 34-byte DLData block layout. A single client
implementation handles both without any generation-specific branching.

The differences between generations are limited to:

| Aspect               | Gen1 (BT-only)         | Gen2 (WiFi+BT)               |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| BLE name pattern     | `PM{S\|D}...` (19 chars) | `WD_{type}_{serial}`        |
| Connectivity         | Bluetooth only         | WiFi + Bluetooth              |
| Error codes          | 0-9, 11-12             | 0-9, 11-14 (adds 13, 14)     |
| GATT characteristic  | `0000ff01...` (same)   | `0000ff01...` (same)          |
| Handshake            | `!%!%,protocol,open,`  | `!%!%,protocol,open,` (same)  |
| Packet framing       | Identical              | Identical                     |
| DLData block layout  | Identical (34 bytes)   | Identical (34 bytes)          |

## Device Generations

### Gen2 (WiFi+BT)

Gen2 devices advertise a BLE name in the format `WD_{type}_{serial}`, where
`{type}` is a two-character model code and `{serial}` is a 12-character
lowercase hex string.

| Type | Amperage | Line Configuration |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| E5   | 30A      | Single-line        |
| E6   | 30A      | Single-line        |
| V5   | 30A      | Single-line        |
| V6   | 30A      | Single-line        |
| E7   | 50A      | Dual-line (L1+L2)  |
| E8   | 50A      | Dual-line (L1+L2)  |
| E9   | 50A      | Dual-line (L1+L2)  |
| V7   | 50A      | Dual-line (L1+L2)  |
| V8   | 50A      | Dual-line (L1+L2)  |
| V9   | 50A      | Dual-line (L1+L2)  |

The second character of the type code determines the line configuration:
`5` or `6` = 30A single-line, `7`, `8`, or `9` = 50A dual-line.

### Gen1 (BT-only)

Gen1 devices advertise a BLE name starting with `PM`, exactly 19 characters
long (may have trailing spaces up to 27 characters).

| Name Prefix | Amperage | Line Configuration |
|-------------|----------|--------------------|
| `PMS...`    | 30A      | Single-line        |
| `PMD...`    | 50A      | Dual-line (L1+L2)  |

The third character (`S` or `D`) determines single vs. dual-line.

## GATT Service

All communication occurs over a single GATT characteristic:

| Property        | Value                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Characteristic  | `0000ff01-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` |
| Properties      | Notify, Write                          |
| Direction       | Notify = device-to-host, Write = host-to-device |

The same UUID is used for both subscribing to notifications (data from the
device) and writing commands (to the device).

## Connection Sequence

1. Scan for BLE devices matching the name patterns above
2. Connect to the device
3. Subscribe to notifications on characteristic `0000ff01`
4. Request MTU 230 (the device sends large packets)
5. Send the handshake payload (see below)
6. Begin receiving framed data packets via notifications

### Handshake

The handshake is an ASCII string written to the characteristic:

```
!%!%,protocol,open,
```

Hex: `21 25 21 25 2c 70 72 6f 74 6f 63 6f 6c 2c 6f 70 65 6e 2c`

The write must use `response=True` (write-with-response). After the
handshake, the device begins streaming DLReport packets via notifications.

## Packet Framing

BLE notifications may contain partial packets. Data must be buffered and
reassembled. Each complete packet has the following structure:

| Offset | Size    | Field          | Description                      |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| 0      | 4 bytes | Identifier     | Magic: `0x24797740`              |
| 4      | 1 byte  | Version        | Protocol version                 |
| 5      | 1 byte  | Message ID     | Sequence number                  |
| 6      | 1 byte  | Command        | Packet type (see below)          |
| 7      | 2 bytes | Data Length     | Big-endian, length of body       |
| 9      | N bytes | Body           | Command-specific payload         |
| 9+N    | 2 bytes | Tail           | Magic: `0x7121`                  |

Total packet size: 9 (header) + N (body) + 2 (tail) = N + 11 bytes.

### Command Types

| Command | Name          | Description                                |
|---------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1       | DLReport      | Live power data (primary data stream)      |
| 2       | ErrorReport   | Error condition notification               |
| 14      | Alarm         | Alarm notification                         |

## DLReport (Command 1)

The DLReport body contains one or two 34-byte DLData blocks:

- **30A (single-line)**: 34 bytes total (one DLData block for L1)
- **50A (dual-line)**: 68 bytes total (two DLData blocks, L1 then L2)

### DLData Block (34 bytes)

Each 34-byte block represents measurements for a single AC line:

| Offset | Size    | Type         | Field             | Unit / Scale          |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 0      | 4 bytes | int32 (BE)   | Input Voltage     | /10000 = Volts        |
| 4      | 4 bytes | int32 (BE)   | Current           | /10000 = Amps         |
| 8      | 4 bytes | int32 (BE)   | Power             | /10000 = Watts        |
| 12     | 4 bytes | int32 (BE)   | Energy            | /10000 = kWh (cumulative) |
| 16     | 4 bytes | int32 (BE)   | Temperature 1     | Reserved (unused)     |
| 20     | 4 bytes | int32 (BE)   | Output Voltage    | /10000 = Volts        |
| 24     | 1 byte  | uint8        | Backlight         |                       |
| 25     | 1 byte  | uint8        | Neutral Detection |                       |
| 26     | 1 byte  | uint8        | Boost Flag        | 1 = boosting          |
| 27     | 1 byte  | uint8        | Temperature       | Degrees; E8/V8 only   |
| 28     | 4 bytes | int32 (BE)   | Frequency         | /100 = Hz             |
| 32     | 1 byte  | uint8        | Error Code        | 0-14 (see table below)|
| 33     | 1 byte  | uint8        | Status            |                       |

All multi-byte integers are **big-endian signed 32-bit** (`int32`).

### Field Notes

- **Input Voltage**: Voltage at the power source (pedestal/shore power).
- **Output Voltage**: Voltage after the Watchdog's regulation/protection.
  May differ from input voltage when the boost feature is active.
- **Energy**: Cumulative kilowatt-hours since the device was last reset.
- **Boost Flag**: Set to `1` when the device is actively boosting low
  voltage (Hughes Autoformer feature on supported models).
- **Neutral Detection**: Indicates the state of neutral wire detection.
- **Backlight**: Display backlight state on the physical device.
- **Temperature 1** (offset 16): Reserved; not used in current firmware.
- **Temperature** (offset 27): Device internal temperature reading.
  **E8/V8 models only** — the decompiled Android app exposes this value via
  `getTemperatureE8()`, confirming it is model-specific. Other models
  (E5/V5, E6/V6, E7/V7, E9/V9) transmit `0` for this byte.
- **Status**: Device operational status byte.

## Error Codes

The error code field (byte 32 of each DLData block) reports the current
fault condition for that AC line. Error codes 0-9 are common to both Gen1
and Gen2 hardware. Gen2 firmware adds codes 11-14.

### Error Code Table

| Code | Title                     | Description |
|------|---------------------------|-------------|
| 0    | No Error                  | Normal operation. |
| 1    | Line 1 Voltage Error      | Input voltage has exceeded 132V or dropped below 104V. The Watchdog has shut off power to protect the RV. Power will be restored automatically after voltage remains in the safe range for 90 seconds. |
| 2    | Line 2 Voltage Error      | Same as code 1, but on Line 2 (50A models only). |
| 3    | Line 1 Over Current       | Current draw exceeds the rated amperage on Line 1. The park breaker should have tripped but did not. Reduce load by turning off a major appliance. Low voltage can cause higher amperage draw. |
| 4    | Line 2 Over Current       | Same as code 3, but on Line 2 (50A models only). |
| 5    | Line 1 Neutral Reversed   | Hot and neutral wires are reversed at the power source. This is a serious wiring fault that can damage appliances. The Watchdog will not allow power through until the condition is corrected. Power restores automatically after a 90-second delay once fixed. |
| 6    | Line 2 Neutral Reversed   | Same as code 5, but on Line 2 (50A models only). Once fixed, the device may require a physical unplug/replug to reset. |
| 7    | Missing Ground             | The ground connection has been lost. Without a ground, the safety breaker cannot trip if a wire contacts the RV chassis, creating a shock hazard. The Watchdog will not allow power without a ground connection. Power restores automatically after a 90-second delay once fixed. |
| 8    | Neutral Missing            | The neutral return path is absent inside the RV. Without a neutral, appliances will burn up quickly. The Watchdog will not allow power until the neutral circuit is restored. |
| 9    | Surge Protection Used Up   | The surge absorption capacity of the internal MOV board has been exhausted. The RV will continue to operate but is no longer protected against surges. The surge board should be replaced. |
| 10   | (Reserved)                | Not used. |
| 11   | Line 1 Frequency Error     | AC frequency on Line 1 is outside the acceptable range. (Gen2 only) |
| 12   | Line 2 Frequency Error     | AC frequency on Line 2 is outside the acceptable range. (Gen2 only) |
| 13   | (Gen2 only)               | Additional error condition. Model-specific; reported on E8/V8 50A units. |
| 14   | (Gen2 only)               | Additional error condition. Model-specific; reported on E6/V6, E8/V8, and E5/V5 units. |

### Error Behaviour

- When an error is detected, the Watchdog disconnects park power from the
  RV to prevent damage.
- For most error conditions (1, 2, 5, 7, 8), the Watchdog continuously
  monitors and automatically restores power after the fault clears and a
  90-second safety delay passes.
- Error 9 (surge protection used up) is a warning only; power is not
  disconnected, but the RV is no longer surge-protected.
- Error codes are reported per-line. On 50A dual-line models, each line
  has its own independent error code byte. A dual-line device may report
  different error codes on L1 and L2 simultaneously.

### Model-Specific Error Content

Some error descriptions vary by model:

- **E5/V5 (30A single)**: Generic single-line descriptions.
- **E6/V6 (30A single)**: Has model-specific content for codes 1-9, 11,
  12, and 14.
- **E8/V8 (50A dual)**: Has model-specific content for codes 1-9, 11-14.
- All other models fall back to the E5/V5 descriptions.

The error *titles* are the same across all models (only the detailed
descriptions differ).

## ErrorReport (Command 2)

An ErrorReport packet is sent by the device when an error condition changes.
The body format is not fully documented but accompanies the error code
already present in the DLReport data.

## Alarm (Command 14)

An Alarm packet indicates an urgent condition reported by the device. The
body format is not fully documented. Receiving an alarm should prompt
immediate attention.

## Protocol Notes

- **MTU**: The device benefits from an MTU of 230 bytes. Smaller MTUs will
  cause DLReport packets (up to 79 bytes framed) to be fragmented across
  multiple BLE notifications, requiring reassembly.
- **Fragmentation**: Notifications may contain partial packets. Implementers
  must buffer incoming data and scan for the 4-byte identifier (`0x24797740`)
  to find packet boundaries.
- **Byte order**: All multi-byte fields in the packet header and DLData
  blocks are big-endian.
- **Polling rate**: The device streams DLReport packets continuously after
  the handshake. The rate depends on the device firmware; typical intervals
  are 100-500ms.
- **Reconnection**: If the BLE connection drops, the full connection
  sequence (subscribe, handshake) must be repeated. There is no session
  resumption.
